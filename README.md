Current challenges:

* A coordinate system for map-based content
* A zoomable/panning user interface
* Modeling documents in graph based data structures with Neo4J
* Decentralized (no-cloud) infrastructure / file storage
* Browser extensions for clipping web content
* Matrix transformations-heavy, physics-based interactions with Famo.us JS
* Interactive documentation, think Bret Vector reactive documents
* iOS / Android apps


## Road Map

Coming shortly.
