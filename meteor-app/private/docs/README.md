WHAT IS THIS?
-------

The images in this directory are an accompanienment to source code. 
You will find references to them in comments across the code, 
in the format 
/*
  DOCS: [image-pathname]
        Tweet-sized desc of *why it's helpful
*/

Example:

/* 
    DOCS: /private/docs/bit-preview-animation-coordinates-v1.jpg
          Example diagram of expand/contracted states,
          and order of solving. It does *not show 
          that the container, and the image need to be animated 
          separately:
            ---- Container Element  ( animates X, Y positions)
            | -----  Img Element    ( animates height, width)
*/

WHY?
-------
Yes, well-written source code should be self-explanatory and is the latest word, as the system evolves.
However, the context often gets lost of what the source is meant to do, and why.
An image can better describe an algorithm or technique, than 5 paragraphs of text/code.
          
Ideally, sketches are updated as source code evolves, bug fixes are made,
however 1:1 parity with the code is not the goal.

Instead, these serve as a spark for conversations.

This is particularly helpful for 
--- math/physics heavy calculations
--- design patterns
