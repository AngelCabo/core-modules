      <h1>What is Parallels?</h1>

      <p>
        A proof of concept for a free + open source workflow tool and a home for your digital stuff. Easily weave together bits of media scattered across your services + devices into meaningful works full of life, and collaborate on them with friends, family + co-workers.
      </p>

      <p>
        This website demo is our engine for continual refinement: here we experiment with new ideas and test what works + what doesn't. 
        It's also your space to play and to follow our progress. 

      </p>

      <p>
        Many things are broken + incomplete: check back often, as daily and even hourly changes are common.

        We use many "free" + cheap digital services today, resulting in bits + pieces of our data scattered across the web. 
        Some tweets here. A google doc there. Images from each new cameraphone flood another cloud.
      </p>

      <p>
        This fragmentation has many
        <a href="http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm" target="_blank">negative consequences</a>, hurting our creativity + compromising our privacy.
        We rarely know where anything is or how to find it.
        We're in this predicament, because advertising and selling our data is the way 
        these services remain free + convenient: our data is their leverage, and their entire  
          <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/

        <p>
          These systems follow a familiar pattern: start with a narrowly defined,  
          <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdorsey/182613360/" target="_blank">basic idea</a>, and after 
          some initial success, further investment fuels growth. More + more of our data is gobbled up to  
          <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man" target="_blank">provide the return</a>, 
          with scale being the magic enabler.

          To achieve this, service providers intentionally design systems which   
          <a href="http://kottke.org/14/07/why-dont-okcupids-experiments-bother-us" target="_blank">actively manipulate us</a>, 
          <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/535906/compulsive-behavior-sells/" target="_blank">look to get us hooked</a>,
          and
          <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/forced-continuity/" target="_blank">prevent us from easily leaving</a>.

        </p>

        <p>
          There are different layers of hurt, and some are not visible: advertising algorithms incorrectly make judgements on  
          <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/you-are-not-your-browser-history-cdff623a3b24" target="_blank">who we are</a> to get their job done, and in the process invisibly

          against us.
        
          There is much debate about  
          <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/28/edward-snowden-petition-rejected-obama-administration" target="_blank">our compromised privacy</a> recently.

        </p>

        <p>
          These effects are often made tangible when one morning a service we depend on is acquired + shuttered:
          Remember that time when large chunks of your digital interactions 
          <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/06/myspace-what-went-wrong-sean-percival-spotify" target="_blank">from several years of your life</a>, disappeared? 
          Or when a tight-knit 
          <a href="http://www.bollier.org/requiem-couchsurfing" target="_blank">community</a> you helped build, disbanded? 
          Or when part of your 
          <a href="http://tech.co/delicious-shutting-down-how-to-save-your-bookmarks-2010-12" target="_blank">memory</a>, evaporated? 
          
          These events give us moments to <a href="http://learningthroughdigitalmedia.net/delicious-renovating-the-mnemonic-architectures-of-bookmarking">pause + reflect</a> on our habits,
          though each closure means a huge investment of our time + attention is lost.

          <a href="https://medium.com/message/never-trust-a-corporation-to-do-a-librarys-job-f58db4673351" target="_blank">This pattern of digital disruption</a>

      <p>
        We're focused on a specific angle of this problem which is hard-to-measure, but easy-to-observe: the experience. 
        Our creativity suffers as a result of data fragmentation, and the notion of getting into any rhythm or state of flow using digital tools is dying.
        We can't easily keep track, access, search, share, and remix our very own thoughts, writings, ideas and communications - all of the things we do on a daily basis. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The experience is our starting point for thinking differently how to change the status quo, and so we ask:

        what does a fun, inspiring home for our digital stuff look like, that easily enables our creativity to flow?
        and how can it be designed without sacrificing our privacy?
      </p>     


    </div>

    <div class="about__section">
      <h1>Who are we?</h1>

      <p>
        We're a community of <a href="https://hackpad.com/Parallels-Community-XGzlw9Mxg39" target="_blank">designers, developers, artists + researchers</a>, looking for collaborators from a broad group of backgrounds + domains: art, design, sound, psychology, security, privacy, neuroscience, video gaming, film, engineering, writing and education. This extends not just around discipline, but also on a personal level -- we're looking to actively build an inclusive, diverse group from the beginning.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about__section">
      <h1>How?</h1>

      <p>
        Open source languages, systems and frameworks are our primary toolset. We're also pushing ourselves with our process: how we collaborate + excercise transparency. We
        believe stealth mode is generally a fallacy: we've gotten this far by sharing what we're doing with as many people as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond transparency is a bigger issue: sustainability. We're not quite sure about the details but we know what we <b
          class="caps">won't</b> do: sell what we make. Sell people's data. Sell ads. These are not models of sustainability we're looking to explore.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather, we're inspired by
        <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/year-2/" target="_blank">Ghost.org</a>,
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a>,
        <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-why-should-i-trust-you" target="_blank">Telegram</a>,
        <a href="https://spideroak.com/features/private-by-design" target="_blank">SpiderOak</a>,
        and other organizations + projects who value transparency + data privacy. 
        Our goal is to create a non-profit organization and run a crowdfunding campaign for short term funds, and explore direct donation models later, where
        benefactors (you!) support the project via micro-donations.
      </p>

      <p>
        We don't yet know exactly how this will work, but lots of interesting things are happening: forward thinking
        non-profits are <a
          href="http://suegardner.org/2013/10/20/whats-really-wrong-with-nonprofits-and-how-we-can-fix-it"

        <a href="http://suegardner.org/2014/11/30/whats-wrong-with-restricted-grants/" target="_blank">raise money</a>,
        and a

           target="_blank">new wave of digital currency platforms</a>
        are giving us a lot of ideas + leads.
      </p>

      <p>
        For now, we're focused on designing a wonderful experience, and sticking to our core principles to guide us as
        we iterate.
      </p>

    </div>


    <div class="about__section">
      <h1>How is this different than the rest?</h1>

      <p>4 key design principles guide our design + vision:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b><i class="fa fa-paper-plane fa__leading-li"></i> Flow</b>, the prerequisite for creativity: an environment without barriers, and designed with encouragement to play: infinite undo/redo. Always remember where you left off. Fun.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b> <i class="fa fa-adjust fa__leading-li"></i> Remixability</b>, because everything is a remix. Anything can be assembled + broken apart, recombined,
          rearranged - just like digital Lego.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b><i class="fa fa-unlink fa__leading-li"></i> Connections</b>,Â use the power of association (aka, tagging + links) to
          organize your ideas. Search your stuff in ways you've never done before, and discover new ideas from others
          where you least expect it.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b><i class="fa fa-briefcase fa__leading-li"></i> Private by design</b>, Your data is yours, by default. Free thinking requires freedom from scrutiny. You own it, and no one can access it unless you explicitly publish it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="about__section">
      <h1>What would I use this for?</h1>

      <p>

          Are you
        <ul>
          <li>looking to keep an ongoing collection of your notes + ideas, in context of your web history + research?</li>

          <li>researching and writing a book over a long period of time, with more than just words for inspiration and
            reference?
          </li>

          <li>working on a class assignment, term paper or other research project, and are having trouble compiling bits +
            pieces from many places, including your social media profiles?
          </li>

          <li>making a presentation for work, but are having trouble crafting a coherent narrative?</li>

          <li>trying to organize a body of research, but frustrated with current diagramming tools that feel too much like
            engineering-like flowcharts?
          </li>

          <li>struggling to brainstorm with friends or coworkers on a project, and are looking for a shared digital space
            that you can move back and forth between working individually and simultaneously?
          </li>

          <li>researching + designing a film? a play? a comic? a book? or other narrative where Google docs just isn't
            cutting it?
          </li>


        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>
          See a pattern? We're all storytellers in one way or another; struggling to make sense of fragmented bits of information during work + play. How would you use Parallels? <a href="http://www.twitter.com/makeparallels" target="_blank">Tell us!</a>

    </div>


    <div class="about__section">

      <h1>When?</h1>

      <p>
        As opposed to a hard release date, we've set up the foundational infrastructure enabling us
        to experiment + iterate. . 
      </p>

      <p>
        We've chosen a set of capabilities to loosely define our alpha milestone, which you can read more about on the <b>canvas alpha</b> column of our 
          <i class="fa fa-trello fa__inline"></i> <a href="https://trello.com/b/XtenDuNO/parallels-roadmap" target="_blank">
          task</a> board. We see these as the core which overlaps across a wide variety of use cases, and the required aspects that will sum up to an impactful + useful experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          With this early, working base, just enough to start playing with, we're reaching out to our community of over 350+ early adopters for feedback + validation. Once we have a clearer picture of where we are, we'll run a crowdfunding campaign to take us into the beta stage and beyond.
        </p>

         <p>
          Throughout this process, we're looking for fiscal sponsors + partners who see potential
          in our vision, and align with how we work + our core principles.
          Our long term goal is to fund the project directly from people using and benefitting from it.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="about__section">
      
      <a name="privacy"></a>

      <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
      <p>
        For our alpha release, we're currently leaning towards releasing Parallels as a desktop app, where all the data is only accessible to you, on your own computer. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This proof-of-concept is only a playground, meant to communicate the core ideas of our direction.
        It runs on a traditional web server: content is stored on a Heroku cloud server instance, and images are stored on an Amazon S3 server instance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please only upload images or content that you are ok with being public- as any action you've taken (like upload an image, create a bit) can be accessed/undone via our infinite undo capability. This is by design, as our project aims to be a <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/5/186024-managing-your-digital-life/fulltext" target="_blank">PIMS</a>. If you accidently uploaded sensitive information and would like to remove it, please <a href="mailto:steven@parallels.io">contact us</a> and we'll remove it manually from our databases.
