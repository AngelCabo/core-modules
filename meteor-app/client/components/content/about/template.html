      <h1>What is Parallels?</h1>

      <p>
        A proof of concept for a free + open source workflow tool and home for your digital stuff. Easily weave together bits of media scattered across your services + devices into meaningful works full of life, and collaborate on them with friends, family + co-workers.
      </p>

      <p>
        This website demo is our engine for continual refinement: here we experiment with new ideas, test our assumptions of what works + what doesn't and iterate. It's also your space to play, see what we're up to, and hopefully becomes something useful to you as it evolves. 

      </p>

      <p>
        Many things are broken + incomplete: check back often, as daily and even hourly changes are common.

        <p>
          The bits + pieces of data we generate are scattered across the web, in the many "free" + cheap web services we use.
          This hinders our creativity and compromises our privacy.
          We are in this predicament, because advertising and selling our data is the way 
          these services remain free + convenient: our data is their leverage, and we have little choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          We're interested in revisiting many ideas early founders of the early web were experimenting with by asking:

          How do we design+build a home for all of our digital stuff, that
          doesn't sacrifice our privacy, and is a fun, reliable, secure, inspiring place to think, work + play?
        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="
        about__content  
        about__content-long">
        <p>
          We use many "free" + cheap digital services today, resulting in bits and pieces of our data scattered across the web. Some tweets here. A google doc there. Images from our cameraphones piped to the cloud. 
        </p>

        <p>
          To support these systems of convenience + low cost, business models are generally based on some form of 
          <a href="#" target="_blank">advertising + data retention</a>. 
          Each generally starts with a 
          <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdorsey/182613360/" target="_blank"> small, simple idea</a>. With some initial success, further investment is 
          <a href="#" target="_blank">saught</a> to fuel growth, 
          as more + more of our data is gobbled up to provide a 
          <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man" target="_blank">return on investment via scale</a>. 

          To do this, our providers intentionally design systems with active experiments to  
          <a href="http://kottke.org/14/07/why-dont-okcupids-experiments-bother-us" target="_blank">manipulate us</a>, 
          <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/forced-continuity/" target="_blank">prevent us from easily leaving</a>
          , and 
          <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/535906/compulsive-behavior-sells/" target="_blank">get us hooked</a>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          These models have many 
          <a href="http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm" target="_blank">negative consequences</a>:

          Our privacy is severely compromised, which we're learning is not just a problem from some, but 
          <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127461" target="_blank">bad for everyone</a>.
          Algorithms 
          <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/you-are-not-your-browser-history-cdff623a3b24">make assumptions on who we are</a>
          to keep this model afloat, and are
          <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/
          " target="_blank">fundamentally broken.</a>

          There is much debate  
          <a href="">about privacy recently</a>, and by extension, 
          <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-need-for-ubiquitous-data-encryption/2015/07/28/3d145952-324e-11e5-8353-1215475949f4_story.html">encryption</a>
          . Unfortunately, the 
          <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/04/06/john-oliver-interview-political-disengagement-american-public">
          desire for convenience</a>,
          complexity of tools,
          little options,
          and mostly, a lack of hollistic thinking 
          trumps our concerns over where our data actually goes.
        </p>

        <p> 
          More often, these services get 
          <a href="#" target="_blank">acquired and shutter</a>, 
          <a href="" target="_blank">one morning</a>. 
          Imagine losing all the record of the interactions from a period in your life,
          <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/06/myspace-what-went-wrong-sean-percival-spotify"> forever</a>. 
          Or your social interactions with a smaller <a href="http://www.bollier.org/requiem-couchsurfing" target="_blank">community</a>. 
          Or part of your 
          <a href="http://tech.co/delicious-shutting-down-how-to-save-your-bookmarks-2010-12" target="_blank">memory</a>. 
          The list is long, but unfortunately, with our current models, 
          <a href="https://medium.com/message/never-trust-a-corporation-to-do-a-librarys-job-f58db4673351">
          this pattern is just getting started.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many experts  
          <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/all/" target="_blank">community of projects</a>
          thinking deeply about these things, which is good, and the ideas of a 
          <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/5/186024-managing-your-digital-life/fulltext" target="_blank">personal space for our digital stuff</a> is making a comeback, after many
          <a href="http://gamearchitect.net/Articles/SoftwareIsHard.html" target="_blank">cut-short attempts</a> 
          and 
          <a href="" target="_blank">unrealized visions</a>. 

          But the perspective often lacking is a basic one: it's hard to measure but it's easy to observe: 
          this isn't just about privacy: our basic creativity + livelhood greatly suffers because of data fragmentation. 
          We can't easily keep track, access, search, share, and remix our very own thoughts, writings, ideas, communications - all of the things we do on a day-to-day basis, <b>easily</b>. In a fun, inspiring way.
        </p>

        <p>
          As more + more of our ,
          each of these closures marks a disruption in our lives:
          they are taking our investment of time + attention with them, and the precious content we've created with their use, over time, is hostage or lost.
        </p>

        <p>
          The irony: while more + more of our thinking, communication, research, play, publishing, commerce + entertainment moves online, and as we <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/02/unrestricted-internet-access-human-rights-technology-constitution/">debate the idea</a>
          of online access as a
          <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/06/united-nations-declares-internet-access-a-basic-human-right/239911">
          human right</a>
          , more and more of our digital bits + pieces are falling further away from our long-term control.  

          What started as a decentralized<a href="http://nautil.us/issue/21/information/the-future-of-the-web-is-100-years-old">vision</a> of 
          <a href="http://www.udanax.com/green/febe/philosophy.html">fluidly sharing ideas</a>, enabling creativity, radically changing education + empowering people, is floundering as more of the web becomes recentralized and monetized.
        </p>

        <p>
          We're thus revisiting a simple question: 
          What does a rich, fun, useful experience of thinking, working, and playing digitally look like?
        </p>

    <div class="about__section">
      <h1>Who are we?</h1>

      <p>
        We're a community of <a href="https://hackpad.com/Parallels-Community-XGzlw9Mxg39" target="_blank">designers, developers, artists + researchers</a>, looking for collaborators from a broad group of backgrounds + domains: art, design, sound, psychology, security, privacy, neuroscience, video gaming, film, engineering, writing and education. This extends not just around discipline, but also on a personal level -- we're looking to actively build an inclusive, diverse group from the beginning.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about__section">
      <h1>How?</h1>

      <p>
        Open source languages, systems and frameworks are our primary toolset. We're also pushing ourselves with our process: how we collaborate + excercise transparency. We
        believe stealth mode is generally a fallacy: we've gotten this far by sharing what we're doing with as many people as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond transparency is a bigger issue: sustainability. We're not quite sure about the details but we know what we <b
          class="caps">won't</b> do: sell what we make. Sell people's data. Sell ads. These are not models of sustainability we're looking to explore.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather, we're inspired by
        <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/year-2/" target="_blank">Ghost.org</a>,
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a>,
        <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-why-should-i-trust-you" target="_blank">Telegram</a>,
        <a href="https://spideroak.com/features/private-by-design" target="_blank">SpiderOak</a>,
        and other organizations + projects who value transparency + data privacy. 
        Our goal is to create a non-profit organization and run a crowdfunding campaign for short term funds, and explore direct donation models later, where
        benefactors (you!) support the project via micro-donations.
      </p>

      <p>
        We don't yet know exactly how this will work, but lots of interesting things are happening: forward thinking
        non-profits are <a
          href="http://suegardner.org/2013/10/20/whats-really-wrong-with-nonprofits-and-how-we-can-fix-it"
          target="_blank">starting to think differently</a> about how to effectively
        <a href="http://suegardner.org/2014/11/30/whats-wrong-with-restricted-grants/" target="_blank">raise money</a>,
        and a

           target="_blank">new wave of digital currency platforms</a>
        are giving us a lot of ideas + leads.
      </p>

      <p>
        For now, we're focused on designing a wonderful experience, and sticking to our core principles to guide us as
        we iterate.
      </p>

    </div>


    <div class="about__section">
      <h1>How is this different than the rest?</h1>

      <p>4 key design principles guide our design + vision:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b><i class="fa fa-paper-plane fa__leading-li"></i> Flow</b>, the prerequisite for creativity: an environment without barriers, and designed with encouragement to play: infinite undo/redo. Always remember where you left off. Fun.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b> <i class="fa fa-adjust fa__leading-li"></i> Remixability</b>, because everything is a remix. Anything can be assembled + broken apart, recombined,
          rearranged - just like digital Lego.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b><i class="fa fa-unlink fa__leading-li"></i> Connections</b>, use the power of association (aka, tagging + links) to
          organize your ideas. Search your stuff in ways you've never done before, and discover new ideas from others
          where you least expect it.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b><i class="fa fa-briefcase fa__leading-li"></i> Private by design</b>, Your data is yours, by default. Free thinking requires freedom from scrutiny. You own it, and no one can access it unless you explicitly publish it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="about__section">
      <h1>What would I use this for?</h1>

      <p>

          Are you
        <ul>
          <li>looking to keep an ongoing collection of your notes + ideas, in context of your web history + research?</li>

          <li>researching and writing a book over a long period of time, with more than just words for inspiration and
            reference?
          </li>

          <li>working on a class assignment, term paper or other research project, and are having trouble compiling bits +
            pieces from many places, including your social media profiles?
          </li>

          <li>making a presentation for work, but are having trouble crafting a coherent narrative?</li>

          <li>trying to organize a body of research, but frustrated with current diagramming tools that feel too much like
            engineering-like flowcharts?
          </li>

          <li>struggling to brainstorm with friends or coworkers on a project, and are looking for a shared digital space
            that you can move back and forth between working individually and simultaneously?
          </li>

          <li>researching + designing a film? a play? a comic? a book? or other narrative where Google docs just isn't
            cutting it?
          </li>


        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>
          See a pattern? We're all storytellers in one way or another; struggling to make sense of fragmented bits of information during work + play.

    <div class="about__section">

      <h1>When?</h1>

      <p>
        As opposed to a hard release date, we've set up the foundational infrastructure enabling us
        to experiment + iterate. . 
      </p>

      <p>
        We've chosen a set of capabilities to loosely define our alpha milestone, which you can read more about on the <b>canvas alpha</b> column of our

          task</a> board. We see these as the core which overlaps across a wide variety of use cases, and the required aspects that will sum up to an impactful + useful experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          With this early, working base, just enough to start playing with, we're reaching out to our community of over 350+ early adopters for feedback + validation. Once we have a clearer picture of where we are, we'll run a crowdfunding campaign to take us into the beta stage and beyond.
        </p>

         <p>
          Throughout this process, we're looking for fiscal sponsors + partners who see potential
          in our vision, and align with how we work + our core principles.
          Our long term goal is to fund the project directly from people using and benefitting from it.

      <a name="privacy"></a>

      <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
      <p>
        For our alpha release, we're currently leaning towards releasing Parallels as a desktop app, where all the data is only accessible to you, on your own computer. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This proof-of-concept is only a playground, meant to communicate the core ideas of our direction.
        It runs on a traditional web server: content is stored on a Heroku cloud server instance, and images are stored on an Amazon S3 server instance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please only upload images or content that you are ok with being public- as any action you've taken (like upload an image, create a bit) can be accessed/undone via our infinite undo capability. This is by design, as our project aims to be a <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/5/186024-managing-your-digital-life/fulltext" target="_blank">PIMS</a>. If you accidently uploaded sensitive information and would like to remove it, please <a href="mailto:steven@parallels.io">contact us</a> and we'll remove it manually from our databases.
