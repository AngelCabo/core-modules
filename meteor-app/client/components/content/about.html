    <h1>What is Parallels?</h1>

    <p>
      This is a proof of concept of a free + open source workflow tool designed to help you convert your distraction into value. It lets you easily stitch together bits of media living across many devices + services, into meaningful, creative works full of life.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're a community of <a href="https://hackpad.com/Parallels-Community-XGzlw9Mxg39" target="_blank">designers, developers, artists + researchers</a>, who feel the status quo falls incredibly short. 
      We're designing+building a better alternative to thinking, working and playing digitally, drawing from many inspirational projects both old + new.
    </p>

    <p>Our goal is to set up a non-profit, raise funding via crowd sourcing and institutional grants in the short term, and later directly via people who will use+benefit from the project. We're not quite sure yet how, but we know what we <b class="caps">won't</b> do: sell what we make. sell people's data. sell ads.</p>

    <p>This proof of concept demo evolves daily, as we go: check back often.

    <h1>4 design principles</h1>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <b><i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i> Flow</b>: the pre-requisite for creativity: a low risk environment to easily play. Infinite undo/redo. Always remember where you left off. Fun.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b> <i class="fa fa-adjust"></i> Remixability</b>: Anything can be assembled + broken apart, recombined, rearranged - just like digital Lego.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b><i class="fa fa-unlink"></i> Connections</b>:Â use the power of association (aka, tagging + links) to organize your ideas. Search your stuff in ways you've never before, and discover new ideas from others where you least expect it.
        </li>
        

        <li>
          <b><i class="fa fa-briefcase"></i> Private by design</b>: Your data is private by default, unless you explicitly publish it. No advertising, because we'll have no access to your data. <a href="https://spideroak.com/features/private-by-design" target="_blank" >Zero Knowledge</a> storage model inspired.

          <p>
            
            Please note, this proof of concept is still very early. In it's current form, only one <b>public</b> canvas is available: please do not upload anything you wouldn't share publicly. If you make a mistake, please contact us asap to remove it.
          </p>

        </li>
      </ul>

    <h1>What would I use this for?</h1>
    
    <p>
      
      Are you
        <ul>
          <li>looking to keep an ongoing collection of your notes, ideas, in context of your web history + research?</li>

          <li>reseaching and writing a book over a long period of time, with more than just words for inspiration and reference?</li>

          <li>working on a class assignment, or term paper, and are having trouble compiling bits + pieces from many places, including your social media profiles?</li>

          <li>making a presentation for work, but are having trouble crafting a coherent narrative?</li>  

          <li>trying to organize a body of research, but frustrated with current diagramming tools that feel too much like engineering-like flowcharts?</li>

          <li>struggling to brainstorm with friends or co-workers on a project, on a shared digital space that you can work on alone, and later see + interact with at the same time?</li>

          <li>researching + designing a film? a play? a comic? a book? or other narrative where Google docs arent cutting it?</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          See a pattern? We're all storytellers in one way or another, struggling with fragmented work + play.

    <h1>When?</h1>

    <p>
      We're working towards an early alpha release by the end of summer 2015.
      We're then inviting 350+ early adopters to share feedback, help us iterate on our designs, and explore many ways it can be used. 

      Once we have a clearer picture, we planning on running a crowfunding campaign to take us into the beta stage, while we also look for institutional sponsors + partners, along with fiscal sponsorship.
    </p>

    <h1>How?</h1>

    <p>
      We're intentionally looking for collaborators from a broad group of backgrounds + domains: art, design, sound, psychology, neuroscience, video gaming, film, writing, education. This extends not just around discipline, but also on a personal level -- we are actively building an inclusive, diverse culture from the get go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open source languages, systems and frameworks are our primary toolset. We're also looking to push ourselves with our process - particulary how we collaborate, and with transparency, similar to Buffer + ghost.org. We believe stealth mode is generally a fallacy: we've gotten this far by sharing what we're doing with as many people as possible.
    </p>
