# Plugins

Plugins extend the functionality of Mousetrap.  To use a plugin just include the plugin after mousetrap.

```html
<script src="mousetrap.js"></script>
<script src="mousetrap-global-bind.js"></script>
```

## Global bind

Allows you to set global bindings that work even inside of input fields.
